    Throughout this week, I was mostly working on the sample Rails application along with Shekhar
    and also on the documentation of the daru-io gem repository. With the coding period coming
    closer and closer to an end, the focus is currently on turning the project into a deliverable
    open-source project, which could benefit from community (open-source) contribution.

    ---Sample Rails Application---

    - Repository : [GitHub link](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru_examples_io_view_rails)
    - Deployed Application : [Heroku link](https://daru-examples-io-view-rails.herokuapp.com/)

    With the Rails application being deployed to Heroku, demonstrating the sample application
    is much easier. The Pull Requests
    [Download as {format}](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru_examples_io_view_rails/pull/6) and
    [HTML Importer showcase](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru_examples_io_view_rails/pull/10)
    have been merged and deployed. As it can be seen from the [election controller](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru_examples_io_view_rails/blob/master/app/controllers/election_controller.rb#L5-L22),
    all the visualization entities like DataTable, Pie Chart and Column Chart have been achieved in
    just a couple of lines of code. Here's a code snippet of the controller -

    <pre>
      <code>
      #! app/controllers/election_controller.rb

      class ElectionController < ApplicationController

        layout :resolve_layout

        def data
          @df_stock = Daru::DataFrame.from_html('http://eciresults.nic.in/PartyWiseResult.htm').first
          @df_stock.delete_row(-1) # delete the 'Total' row for visualization purpose
          
          data                = @df_stock.map_vectors { |x| [x.name, x.to_a.map { |y| y.to_i.to_s==y ? y.to_i : y } ] }.to_h
          new_df              = Daru::DataFrame.new('Party' => data['Party'], 'Won' => data['Won'])
          opts                = { adapter: :googlecharts, height: 500, width: 1000 }
          table_opts          = { adapter: :googlecharts, pageSize: 10, height: 300, width: 400 }
          @df_stock_table     = Daru::View::Table.new(@df_stock, table_opts) # DataTable entity
          @df_stock_pie_chart = Daru::View::Plot.new(new_df, type: :pie, **opts) # Pie Chart entity
          @df_stock_col_chart = Daru::View::Plot.new(new_df, type: :histogram, **opts) # Column Chart entity
        end

        private

        def resolve_layout
         case action_name
           when 'data'
            "googlecharts_layout"
           else
            Daru::View.plotting_library = :nyaplot
            "application"
           end
        end
      end
      </code>
    </pre>

    Great, the controller part is done. But for visualization, we obviously need to have
    the views part. Here's the most simple way to embed the DataTable or Charts.

    <pre>
      <code>
      #! app/views/election/data.erb

      <%=raw @df_stock_table.div %>
      <%=raw @df_stock_pie_chart.div %>
      <%=raw @df_stock_col_chart.div %>
      </code>
    </pre>


    Here are a few screenshots showcasing the above example of election data with the use of
    HTML Importer.

    ---Documenting the daru-io repository---

    Irrespective of how well written the code is, the software won't be friendly for users unless
    it is well documented. With daru-io to be transferred to SciRuby organzization on GitHub
    soon enough, it is quite necessary to add files : **README**, **LICENSE**, **CODE OF CONDUCT**,
    **CONTRIBUTING** and so on. They are being added quite exhaustively in
    [this Pull Request](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io/pull/50), to ensure that users
    and contributors of daru-io, find it easier to develop with daru-io.

    Meanwhile, a discussion regarding the calls of read-write methods from daru to daru-io is going
    on, in [this issue](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io/issues/29). Also,
    [Pjotr](https://github.com/pjotrp)'s suggestion of adding benchmarks for daru-io to identify
    the IO modules that might require faster approaches, sounds good and this is something that
    daru-io users could need, to decide on faster formats to import / export. Though this might not
    be possible within the GSoC 2017 timeline, I'd definitely like to add these benchmarks after GSoC 2017.
