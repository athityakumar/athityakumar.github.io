    First week of Coding period of GSoC 2017 as per my timeline, started on the 
    29th of May 2017. This was something I was really looking up to, right from 
    the moment I was selected by SciRuby organization 
    ( [GitHub](https://github.com/SciRuby/) | [Website](http://sciruby.com/) ) 
    for my project idea `daru-io`. In my opinion, the first week was very 
    interesting and productive. Through this blog post, I'd like to document my 
    progress during this week.

    ---HTML Importer for daru---

    During the earlier part of this week, I continued on my Pull Request 
    regarding the HTML Importer method for daru , `Daru::DataFrame.from_html()`. 
    Through this method, I implemented web scraping to get tables from a HTML 
    page and convert them to an `Array` of `Daru::DataFrame`s. The `Mechanize` 
    gem has been used to implement web scraping. 


    Though the method is now able to properly parse the dataframes from a couple 
    of websites, it does have a downside. The downside is that, there are 
    websites that dynamically load the HTML tables by inline JS, and this method 
    won't be able to parse such tables. 

    The logic behind detection of index and order of a table can be seen from 
    [this Pull Request](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pull/311). Have a look at 
    a couple of screenshots documenting the method with an example -

    ---Setting up daru-io repository---

    - Repository : [daru-io](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io)
    - Functionality Testing : [RSpec](http://rspec.info/)
    - Static Code Analyzer : [Rubocop](http://batsov.com/rubocop/)
    - Continous Integration : [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
    - Documentation Tool for the Ruby gem : [YARD]("http://yardoc.org/)

    ---Porting existing IO modules of daru to daru-io---

    The existing IO modules of daru - 5 importers and 2 exporters, are to be 
    ported to the daru-io repository to ensure that subsequent IO modules that 
    are to be newly formed, look consistent with the older ones. That way, 
    daru-io can also be released as a plugin gem to daru, by August end. By 
    Friday, I had ported the existing modules with updated YARD docs styling and 
    modern syntax for RSpec tests. However, a [review comment](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io/pull/16#discussion_r119859429) by mentor 
    [Victor (@zverok)](https://github.com/zverok) seems to suggest a better 
    inheritence layout and usage methodology to daru-io modules. 


    That is, something used like `Daru::IO::Exporters::CSV.write('path/to/csv/file', options)` can now be used with lazy-calling feature such as, 

    <pre>
      <code>
      csv_exporter = Daru::IO::Exporters::CSV.new('path/to/csv/file', options)
      # Do some thing here
      csv_exporter.write
      </code>
    </pre>

    This is still under progress with [this Pull Request](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io/pull/16), and isn't merged yet. Once the lazy-calling 
    feature has been approved for one module, it is easy to extend them to other 
    modules. I've been putting effort from my side, and it hopefully doesn't 
    delay my timeline. But if it does, I've a swiss-knife up my sleeve called 
    'Buffer period', which is meant for handling such delays.

    ---Adding fixture files to daru-io---

    Fixture files are the input files that are used in testing the modules 
    (importers, in my case). As I'd like to tackle various format importers such 
    as Redis, Mongodb, JSON, Avro, RData & RDS in my GSoC tenure, it's a good 
    starting point to start adding the fixture files. Progress regarding this has 
    been made in 
    [this Pull Request](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io/pull/17), 
    and is yet to be merged.
