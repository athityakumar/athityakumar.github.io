    Throughout this week, I was primarily working on the Avro Importer-Exporter modules and improving
    the documentation of the repository. I also worked on adding the "Export as {format}" button examples
    for more formats such as JSON & RDS.

    On a sidenote, I also attended online test and 3 rounds of interview for Goldman Sachs for the role of
    Summer Analyst. The online test consisted of 3 sections - Coding, Quant and Machine Learning. I was able
    to clear the online tests. All 3 rounds of interview were about coding and very light HR questions.
    However, it turned out to be one of the interviews that go well, but you still don't get selected after
    the final round and question yourself for a week regarding why you were rejected.

    ---Avro IO modules---

    At the beginning of this week, [this Pull Request](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io/pull/48)
    was submitted to add the Avro Importer & Exporter modules. For the Avro IO modules,
    [avro gem](https://github.com/apache/avro/tree/master/lang/ruby) has been used. A small code snippet
    that was used in the Avro Importer, has been added in the previous blog post. Meanwhile, here's a code
    snippet which makes the Avro Exporter work.

    <pre>
      <code>
      class Daru::IO::Exporters::Avro < Daru::IO::Exporters::Base
        def call
          @schema_obj = process_schema
          @writer     = ::Avro::IO::DatumWriter.new(@schema_obj)
          @buffer     = StringIO.new
          @writer     = ::Avro::DataFile::Writer.new(@buffer, @writer, @schema_obj)
          @dataframe.each_row { |row| @writer << row.to_h }
          @writer.close

          File.open(@path, 'w') { |file| file.write(@buffer.string) }
        end

        private

        def process_schema
          case @schema
          when ::Avro::Schema then @schema
          when String         then ::Avro::Schema.parse(@schema)
          when Hash           then ::Avro::Schema.parse(@schema.to_json)
          else raise ArgumentError, 'Invalid Avro Schema provided.'
          end
        end
      end
      </code>
    </pre>

    ---Rails example---

    The Rails App that serves as an example to demonstrate the working of 
    [daru-io](https://github.com/athityakumar/daru-io) and
    [daru-view](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru-view)
    with [daru](https://github.com/SciRuby/daru)
    is under active development, in
    [this repository](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru_examples_io_view_rails).
    Support for "Export as {format}" has been added for more formats such as JSON & RDS, in
    [this Pull Request](https://github.com/Shekharrajak/daru_examples_io_view_rails/pull/6).

    Here are a few screenshots depicting the "Export as {format}" buttons and the downloaded
    files -
