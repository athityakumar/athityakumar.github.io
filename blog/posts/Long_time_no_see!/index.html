              - the one that I had

              that got skipped in this blog, a lot of life-changing events happened.
              Brace yourselves; because this is going to quickly escalate like Thor&#39;s

            <p>Shortly after coming back to college from my internship, I received a PPO (Pre-Placement Offer) 
              from Intuit India. This came as a huge sigh of relief - given the struggle I had already gone
              through to land a Software Development internship being a Mechie. Also, this meant that I would be officially out of the rat-race for campus placements at IIT Kharagpur.</p>
            <p>What followed for the next couple of months is what&#39;s called &quot;PPO life&quot; - aka, the
              tension-free peaceful time that can just be spent with friends and passing time without
              any regrets. And that&#39;s exactly what I did with my wingies - we&#39;d assemble at one of our
              rooms and just spend time together for hours and hours. The activities ranged from card
              games (290, UNO), dumb charades to binging any movie/series, or even just discussing
              something randomly (read, ganging up on one of us).</p>

            <p>The next good news that I received during this phase was that, my
              <a target='_blank' href="http://sciruby.com/">GSOC organization (SciRuby)</a> had chosen me as one of
              the two mentors to attend the GSOC Mentor Summit held at the San Fransisco! For almost
              2-3 weeks, I was just rumbling and hustling to get the VISA process done at any cost - as
              it&#39;s a great opportunity to network with more like-minded people who&#39;re very enthusiastic
              about open-source. Thankfully, everything went well and I was able to get the VISA
              application approved in time.</p>
            <p>Right when I left to attend this mentor summit, I also got a ping from my college folks
              that I had been selected to represent our college in the Inter-IIT Tech Meet 2019. Ever
              since I participated in the Inter-IIT Tech Meet of 2017, I had been waiting to experience
              the thrill of getting to face-off against the best tech minds across India one more time!</p>
            <p>The summit was organized pretty well, given the sheer number of mentors that come
              and participate in it ...</p>

            <p>... and the whole <strong>&quot;Crowd-sourced collaboration of chocolates&quot;</strong> was a really fun activity
              where mentors would all buy and stack chocolates from their native places ...</p>

            <p>As an icing on the cake, I also got a free pass for the GitHub Developer Meet - which
              coincidentally happened around the same span of 7 days and very much in the near vicinity.
              As a result, I got to meet a couple of GitHubbers in real life and put a face/name to the
              <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/education/classroom/commits?author=athityakumar">GitHub Classroom contributions</a>

            <p>All in all, it was just very wholesome and maybe even a bit surreal/overwhelming that all of
              these good things were coming together and happening at the same time during my final year!</p>
            <p><strong>Meanwhile, the universe:</strong> <em>(does sinister laugh)</em> &quot;It&#39;s all going too well for him,
              it&#39;d be a shame if I manage to ruin it somehow. Hmmmmmm.&quot;</p>

            </p>
            <p>As the 9th semester got completed, I stayed back at college for a couple more days to help
              out friends with their placement process - to do whatever I could from my part. Almost 10 days
              into this placement process, most of my friends who wanted to take up a job had already gotten
              placed - so, I packed up and made my way home. </p>
            <p>When I reached back home, I came to know something really shocking. Around October 2019, my
              dad had gone through a <strong>stroke-like symptom</strong>. Ever since, dad has been taking tests to
              figure out the actual issue - yup, this included CT scans, MRIs and other full-body checks.
              They had waited to tell me this in person so that I don&#39;t panic while being in
              college - from where I can take no action.</p>
            <p>Right after coming back, we went to another check-up and the doctors were still not able to pinpoint
              the exact issue - with uncertainty looming across multiple possibilities (Brain Tumour, TB, etc).
              With no other option left to find out the issue without an intrusive procedure, we opted for a
              brain biopsy ASAP, as we didn&#39;t want to delay it any further; after all with the uncertainty of illness, inaction or untimely action could be an unnecessary gamble to take when the stakes are high.</p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>&quot;Always expect the best, but also prepare for the worst&quot; - Appa</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Even in the best case, as this was going to be intrusive brain surgery, it was possible that
              dad may regain entire brainpower (memory, coordination, calculation, etc) only gradually over the
              next couple of months. An analogy would be how our eyes take time to become non-foggy once we
              use eye-drops.</p>
            <p>What followed for the next 2 weeks was intense KTs (knowledge transfers) as
              Mom &amp; I had to handle everything that dad used to previously handle. Thanks to all the support
              provided by relatives, doctors and the universe; the surgery turned out to be a
              total success.</p>
            <p><strong>For the folks who&#39;re curious about this &quot;Outlier&quot; of a medical case:</strong> It turned out to be 
              a rare case of TB that had somehow made it&#39;s way to the nervous system - rare, because it
              usually makes its way through the respiratory system and is supposed to be pretty easy to
              pinpoint because of its symptoms. But hey, wellllll, dad is one of a kind and his medical
              case plainly followed suit. ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯</p>

            <p><strong><em>Thankfully, after almost a year of TB medication, my dad has pretty much recovered in all
                  aspects and back in shape - maybe even better than before!</em> :)</strong></p>
            <p>Going back into my final semester of college, I was filled with a lot of confidence and &quot;make the
              most out of it&quot; mentality - that survivors typically tend to have. I went all out
              (read, batshit crazy) opting for a 30-credit semester that took the peace aspect out
              of the last semester. This semester was definitely going to be one that would
              require me to over-exert myself - survivors shouldn&#39;t be chilling, amirite?</p>
            <p>A couple of things did make this final semester fun for me even though I over-exerted myself. I
              worked on extra projects and got to know/team-up with some pretty talented folks! On the positive
              front, this semester was also a series of firsts in contrast to the series of lasts it was
              supposed to be:</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>

               </h4>
            <p>I made an awesome acquaintance in <a target='_blank' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/garima-arora-2b834b93/">Garima</a>,
              who let me know about this degree called PGDBA (which has been emerging as a competitor to an MBA
              in recent days) and also gives me free management tips. We teamed up for a term-project called
              Harvey (

              and as a result, got to know a lot about Indian constitutional laws, most famous cases and
              their network analysis.</p>

              the given problem statement end-to-end. Comprising of mostly freshers and sophomores, I&#39;m very
              pleased to have led our team and was pleasantly surprised by how much skill they managed to
              acquire in the short span of less than a month. Thanks for making this an awesome experience, team!</p>

            <p>It&#39;s probably not a process that someone can put a number on; rather, it&#39;s more of an ongoing
              process that requires conscious effort. It&#39;s not about favouring to be one or other among the
              introvert and extrovert personas; rather, it&#39;s about being flexible to embrace both - as per
              the necessity.</p>

               </h4>
            <p>And randomly two days after the Opensoft event ended: <strong>&quot;Ouch, ouch, that hurt! What&#39;s this pain?
                Where&#39;s it even coming from?&quot; :-/</strong></p>
            <p>My wingies immediately called an ambulance and admitted me into BC Roy Hospital. Without any
              prelim test, the doctor who was present at that time just said it would be a case of Pancreatic
              inflation - which is supposed to be pretty bad. Thankfully, the next doctor who came in did
              suggest a prelim test and it turned out to be Appendicitis - yup, that&#39;s pretty frequently
              occurring and relatively a smaller issue. Phew!</p>
            <p>Looks like my over-exertion was finally showing off - pretty apparently. In the process of working
              on all these different projects with different people, I had torn apart my sleep and diet cycle
              consistently for almost a month - which most probably led to the random pain on that random day.</p>
            <p>Reality checks are often the best in putting things into perspective. The week I rested at the
              hospital definitely mellowed the &quot;survivor&quot; over-exertion instincts in me for good. After that,
              the final-semester was back to being like a final-semester. Less of work, more of connecting with
              people and spending time in a memorable manner.</p>

            <p>Coming back home with the thought that of leaving all the friends and the campus behind is
              definitely an excruciatingly sad phase that all graduates have to go through. Or rather, this
              is the phase where everyone definitely gets to master the skill of living in denial. Reality
              can&#39;t be sad if you don&#39;t accept reality right? <em>(sob)</em></p>
            <p>The last night of mine on campus, we (wingies) decided to roam around the campus - just trying to
              make sense of our 5 years through this campus (and life). We dub it <strong>&quot;The Long Night&quot;</strong>. GoT
              fam, hi-5!</p>

            <p>But there&#39;s one flaw with living in denial - it doesn&#39;t really work once you&#39;ve boarded your
              cab/train/flight back to your home - unless you&#39;re delusional of course. And even though I
              factually knew that we may be parting ways for a long time, it was when I sat in the cab that
              reality actually struck me.</p>
            <p>I was sad for almost a week at home - for no particular reason. I was glad to know later that 
              it was actually a shared feeling - yay, validation! After a week, life moved on and I moved on
              too <em>(nope, I still haven&#39;t - nope, just kidding)</em>.</p>
            <p>It was time to figure out some stuff before I started with my full-time job at Intuit India. First
              and foremost, I wanted to fix the health part - that random pain on that random day was a very
              eerie and troubling experience for me. I definitely didn&#39;t want to experience it again - so, I had
              the Appendicitis removed and just rested for a month.</p>
            <p>Next, I wanted one final hard-core start-up experience to get to learn more. I got to know about
              a pretty fun start-up called Memeois from <a target='_blank' href="https://asquare14.github.io/">Atibhi</a>. They had my attention, the moment I came to know that it&#39;s a platform for making and sharing memes. They even
              have a meme profiler and meme recommendation system - which is pretty sick. I came to know about a
              ton of AWS services, and various optimizations after working on Memeois. Thanks a lot for offering
              me this great opportunity, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anushkmittal/">Anushk</a>! It was a fun
              2-months working for Memeois, but with my job at Intuit starting in a month, I sadly
              had to part ways with them.</p>
            <p>And the one last month? It was mostly dedicated to looking for houses at
              Bangalore, and planning for packing/moving process that&#39;d come next.</p>

            <p>Moving from Chennai to Bangalore was pretty much a bittersweet change. It was wholesome for
              most of the part:</p>

                <li>Convocation: Not that the degree helped me much in my pursuit, but physically receiving it
                  as a reward for enduring all the 5 years of IITKGP life was pretty sick! &lt;3</li>

            <p>A cool addition to the convocation was being called as a panellist for the SWG session to throw
              some light about the placements scenario - that&#39;s when I knew I&#39;ve finally made it through a full-circle.</p>

            <p>I was allotted a different team (<strong>Data Platform</strong>) from the one I had
              interned with (<strong>Pro-Connect Group</strong>), as there had been a slight restructuring of the previous
              team. As a result, everything was new as I started out my first job. This new team sat in
              a different building, and obviously had a way different problem statement to solve. As a
              fresh graduate, I was pretty much clueless even about the concepts of &quot;data lake&quot; and scalable
              data architectures - leave alone just the tech-stacks. </p>
            <p>For the first month or two, I had a lot of ground to cover getting familiar with the technologies
              that are generally used for this: Scala, Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, etc. A huge kudos to my buddy (aka,
              mentor) <a target='_blank' href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sanketsahu9394/">Sanket Sahu</a> and the entire team in helping
              me out with getting familiar with the diverse set of technologies!</p>
            <p>And of course, the awesome aspect of getting goodies hasn&#39;t changed much from the internship!</p>

            <p>I realize this probably doesn&#39;t look like it aligns with the lessons of over-exertion that my final
              semester taught me. But trust me when I say that it&#39;s just very controlled and I&#39;m not exerting at
              all - leave alone over-exertion. It&#39;s just that weekends may get boring sometimes, and whenever I&#39;ve
              time, I try to participate in them. The objective is mainly to know new people, and new skills from
              them.</p>
            <p>In this phase, I participated in <a target='_blank' href="https://hackupc.com/">HackUPC hackathon</a> held at Barcelona,

              also held at Bangalore. It&#39;s a pretty cool experience each time, because of the sheer randomness
              and the suspense of not knowing what we&#39;ll build or whom I&#39;d be building with. <strong>It&#39;s kinda like

            <p>2020! Yup. It&#39;s the universe&#39;s version of a bamboozle. Imagine people working from home,
              getting fired from their jobs and/or losing their livelihood, postponing their special events
              (marriage, get-togethers, etc) and totally giving up on any plans - all over the world;
              just because someone ate a bat. Domino effect OP!</p>
            <p>Like most people, I&#39;ve been working from home as well. And the WFH issues are real:</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>The paradox</li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>From my prior experience working remotely on Memeois and GSOC project, I thought I&#39;d be able to
              handle WFH slightly better compared to others. But nope, I was wrong - it was surprising to see
              that the WFH I had remembered as being chill and flexible, had somehow just become more hectic with
              more work and more hours.</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>Finding a balance between work &amp; home</li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>It&#39;s very tough striking a balance between work and home in WFH. My initial days of WFH
              used to be either work extending till the night, or work not getting started at all the entire
              day. <em>It still is, but it also used to be.</em> Nope, just kidding - it&#39;s gradually become better
              as we&#39;re all trying to have our days much more planned (compared to ad-hoc meetings resulting in
              random working hours in the initial days). Time management and Mental balance have never been
              more important!</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>The ergonomics</li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>The first couple of days of working with my home desk and chair - nope. Just nope. It&#39;s just not 
              a very ergonomic setup to work long hours. The same applies to the keyboard and mouse as well. Using
              them for a temporary period could be done, but given the prolonged state of affairs, we should soon
              be taking care of proper ergonomics to avoid wrist/back pains. Thankfully, Intuit has been
              providing some of the equipment to ensure that working with inadequate setup doesn&#39;t take
              a long-term toll.</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>The setup</li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>For the first month of WFH, I had no plans of changing my setup as it was just considered a
              temporary situation. But with the prospect of WFH being prolonged maybe even till late-2020, I had
              to put some effort into refactoring my room. It wasn&#39;t just about getting the workspace setup, but it
              was also about adding in elements of homeliness to ensure that it&#39;s a balanced setup which is not totally
              filled with just work-related elements.</p>

            <p>As you can see, I&#39;ve attempted to strike a balance by adding non-work distractions like
              <strong>books, Rubiks cube</strong> and of course <strong>a series to binge-watch</strong>. On my other desk that&#39;s mostly just
              filled with chargers, I&#39;ve a <strong>couple of plants</strong> and a <strong>pinch of pupper magic</strong>.</p>

            <p>PS - This is, of course, just a very genuine effort that&#39;s pretty much rudimentary. It may not
              look so appealing yet, but for everyone who’s looking for ideas to set up a clean workspace at
              their home, <a target='_blank' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMrtXn0612Q">the TechSource YouTube channel</a> has
              been publishing lots of videos on awesome clean workspace setups. Do take up some inspiration
              from them!</p>

            <p>In conclusion, writing such a huge blog post, to sum up, all the events across 1.5 years has made
              it very clear to me that I should not be procrastinating and allow things to accumulate up. As a
              result, I&#39;ll be writing (or at least trying to write) more regularly. Hopefully, my writing
              hasn&#39;t become too rusty/boring.</p>
