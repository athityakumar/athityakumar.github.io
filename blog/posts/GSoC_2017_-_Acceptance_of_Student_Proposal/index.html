              Code&#39;s mail during the 2016 edition. Fast forward to May the Fourth of 2017, 
              my proposal to Ruby Science Foundation ( <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/SciRuby/">Github</a>
              | <a target='_blank' href="http://sciruby.com/">Website</a> ) was accepted. So, what exactly changed 
              between the 2016 and 2017 editions? A lot. This is exactly what this blog post 
              is intended to document, for the benefit of GSoC aspirants who&#39;d like to know 
              on how to get started in this open-source program that is Google Summer of 
              Code. </p>
            <p>First things first, this might vary from time to time, person to person, and 
              organization to organization - now that this acts as a disclaimer, feel free 
              to continue reading.</p>
            <p><br>
              <div class='ui horizontal divider'>Starting early</div>
            </p>
            <p>Folks have quite a mixed bag of opinion regarding whether it is good to start 
              contributing to a project even before the organization has been accepted for 
              GSoC. This mixed bag is typically a risk-versus-return scenario, where some 
              students &#39;take the risk&#39; and get started with a project early because it&#39;s 
              interesting, while many others feel that they can&#39;t risk their efforts. I 
              believe in starting early, keeping in mind that nothing in open-source (or 
              even life, for that matter) ever goes in vain. </p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>GSoC 2016 : I came to know about GSoC 2016 only after the organizations were announced.</li>
                <li>GSoC 2017 : I started my preparations right from January, i.e, even before the list of accepted organizations was announced.</li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>In my opinion, starting early definitely does give you a decisive advantage 
              simply because you have more time to get accustomed with the organization 
              guidelines.</p>
            <p><br>
              <div class='ui horizontal divider'>Choosing with preferences</div>
            </p>
            <p>With a number of project ideas that&#39;re open for Google Summer of Code, it&#39;s 
              really important to single down on the project idea that&#39;d be  most apt and 
              interesting to you. It&#39;s generally good to take enough time to look at the 
              projects and singling down based on your preferences. </p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>
                  <p>GSoC 2016 : The ony preference I had in mind was to look at web projects. As I hadn&#39;t singled down on a project, I applied for five projects without doing enough research / contribution to any of the projects.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>GSoC 2017 : Having started early, I had enough time to go through previous year projects and take an educated guess that they&#39;ll get accepted this year as well. My preferences this year was very clear - I definitely wanted only a Ruby project with optional inclusion of web aspect. I came across the project daru of Ruby Science Foundation, and the acronym was enough to convince me to single down on this project. (Yes, strange motivations)</p>
                </li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>Crack : Daru stands for &#39;Data Analysis in RUby&#39;, while also meaning &#39;Booze&#39; in Hindi.</p>
            <p><br>
              <div class='ui horizontal divider'>Communicating and Contributing</div>
            </p>
            <p>After having chosen the project idea, it&#39;s very important to get in touch 
              with the mentors and the organization. Most of the organizations have a 
              medium such as Mailing list, IRC, Slack, Gitter, etc. where all 
              communications take place. Feel free to introduce yourself, express your 
              ideas, and discuss with other members. It&#39;s also the best place to resolve 
              any doubts / ambiguity regarding the project, but make sure that you&#39;ve done 
              your efforts in solving the issue on your own. It&#39;s good to stay active on 
              these mediums.</p>
            <p>Along with communication, another important aspect is contribution. Go 
              through the project repository, read the README instructions to setup the 
              repository locally and try fixing any of the issues mentioned in the issue 
              tracker of the repository. This is important, as this reveals your 
              familiarity with the project, as well as your consistent temparament in 
              handling Pull Request Reviews.</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li>
                  <p>GSoC 2016 : I wrote just one mail to all the five organizations, introducing myself. There was discussion with only one organization regarding my project proposal - however, that too died down as I wasn&#39;t active on the mailing list. I was able to contribute only to that one project with documentation, and wasn&#39;t able to handle all the proposals with conviction.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>GSoC 2017 : I was active on the SciRuby organization&#39;s mailing list, and 
                    the quick responses from the mentors made me even more active on the 
                    mailing list. I was also able to get <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/SciRuby/daru/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%20is%3Apr%20author%3Aathityakumar%20">6 Pull Requests merged</a>
                    by the proposal period, as I started early. </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p><br>
              <div class='ui horizontal divider'>Proposal drafting and reviews</div>
            </p>
            <p>This is probably the most important and yet the most neglected step. While 
              your contributions showcase your familiarity with the codebase, it&#39;s your 
              proposal that showcases the vision you have for the project and how you plan 
              to implement it. Most organizations do have a proposal template, and it&#39;s 
              preferred to follow the template. And of course, include as many code samples 
              as possible, along with a detailed and feasible weekly timeline schedule. </p>
            <p>If you&#39;ve submitted a draft early, you&#39;ll most probably recieve reviews from 
              your mentors. It&#39;s not required to blindly accept the changes suggested in 
              the review. But if you&#39;re not changing it, at least ensure that you discuss 
              with your mentor(s), regarding why you feel that your initial draft method 
              might be better than the one suggested in the review. In short, explore as 
              many alternatives and express the thoughts that went in choosing a specific 
              alternative over others. More detailed the proposal, the better your chances. </p>

                <li>
                  <p>GSoC 2016 : Drafting 5 proposals within a span of 10 days was tiring, and 
                    almost all my proposals were just generic (without following the proposal 
                    template) and lacked clarity in terms of both plan and timeline.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>GSoC 2017 : I had much more time to draft the proposal for my chosen 
                    project. I submitted an initial draft of 10 pages as per the proposal 
                    template, and was also able to discuss about the reviews suggested. With 
                    more reviews and discussions, came more details and clarity in the 
                    proposal. At the last day of submission, I submitted my 19-page proposal 
                    which looks much better than the initial draft.</p>
