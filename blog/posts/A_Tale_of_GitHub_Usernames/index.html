Well, it is this eerie mystery that this blog post aims to cover, around my circle of friends and mentors - at least, on the GitHub platform. Before starting with the actual blog post, I'd like to provide you with spoiler alert to some memes that have been picked up from the scenes of TV series - 'The Flash' and 'Breaking Bad'.</p>
            <br>
            <div class='ui horizontal divider'>Not all heroes wear a mask</div>

            <p>Indeed. There are many users who prefer to have a mainstream username, which directly exposes their name. The most common reason behind this is that, a mainstream username looks more 'official' at first sight. Need I give any explanation for the below handles?
              <h4>
                <ul class='ui list'>
                  <li><a href='https://github.com/kaustubhhiware' target='_blank'> @kaustubhhiware </a> (Kaustubh Hiware)</li>

                </ul>
              </h4>
              <p>Infact, I myself belong to this category. My GitHub username is <a href='https://github.com/athityakumar' target='_blank'> @athityakumar </a> - and I went for a mainstream username because my name was already spelled weirdly enough, that I didn't even have to think of a more weirder username.</p>

              <div class='ui horizontal divider'>Some heroes wear a psuedo-mask</div>

              <p>By a psuedo-mask, I mean that these usernames reveal the user's name - but it's not just the name that is being revealed.
                <h4>

                        <br>
                         Kshitij truly believes that the Date of Birth of an individual is something that makes the individual unique, and has hence included his Date of Birth (10/04/1996) in his username.</span></li>

                         Vivek Rai is a (final-year) student of IIT Kharagpur, and has hence added the Institute name (iitkgp) to his username.</span></li>

                         Shivani had obtained an All India Rank of 29456 in JEE(Mains) - one of the most competitive college entrance exams in India. Hence, she has added it in her username.</span></li>

                <p>These are the usernames from which the user's name can't be guessed directly - but a corelation between the name and username can certainly be derived.</p>

                         The 'Rege' in the name has been transformed to 'gere' in the username, and 'mih' from Mihir has been added at the end. Hence, the username - @geremih.</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href='https://github.com/amrav' target='_blank'> @amrav </a> (Vikrant Varma) <span style='font-weight:100;'> <br>

                        <br>
                         'zverok' has been the default username of Victor for nearly the past 15 years. The username has Russian origins, and it means 'a small beast' in Russian (зверёк). Seemingly, this username was selected randomly from the absurd play(s) that Victor had written with his friends of that time.</span></li>

                    <li><a href='https://github.com/DefCon-007' target='_blank'> @DefCon-007 </a> (Ayush Goyal)<span style='font-weight:100;'> <br>
                        <br>
                         DefCon is the largest hacking convention, held annually at Las Vegas - Ayush first took this as his nickname for Counter-Strike gaming within the Institute. But as this username was already taken on GitHub, Ayush added the James Bond number '007', and made himself known as 'DefCon-007' on GitHub.</span></li>

                        <br>
                         Sayan had crafted this nickname in his 5th grade itself. During one of the Geography lectures, he came across the different Timezones, and was more attracted to the American Standard Time more than Indian Standard Time. Hence, he had decided that he'd keep himself as @americanst in the digital world to not showcase any details about him. However, a typo while creating his first Yahoo account made sure that he'd rather be called as @americast on all social media platforms. Although a typo, @americast does sound more cooler than @americanst - so, I guess it can be considered a 'Wonder Blunder'.</span></li>

                    <li><a href='https://github.com/ghostwriternr' target='_blank'> @ghostwriternr </a> (Naresh Ramesh)<span style='font-weight:100;'> <br>
                        <br>
                         Many years ago, Naresh had chosen 'ghost_000' as his first linux user account name. He was also a part of Technology Literary Society of IIT Kharagpur due to his interest in writing. Hence, combining `ghost' from ghost_000, 'writer' from writing, 'n' from Naresh and 'r' from Ramesh, the username 'ghostwriternr' was born.</span></li>

                        <br>
                         Being a fan of the 'Mission Impossible' set of movies, Dhruv named himself as 'Ethan Hunt' in one of the Mini Militia gaming marathon in his Institute. Gradually rising among the ranks in the game, Dhruv got a good vibe from this nickname and went on to change his presence in all social media platforms to Ethan Hunt. Wanting to be unique, he chose the username 'the-ethan-hunt'. </span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><a href='https://github.com/zorroblue' target='_blank'> @zorroblue </a> (Rameshwar Bhaskaran)<span style='font-weight:100;'> <br>
                        <br>
                         Being a hardcore fan of Beyblade's Kai and Zorro animated series, he wanted a username like Kai / Zorro. However, both Kai and Zorro usernames were already taken on GitHub. Hence, he combined Zorro, with his favourite color (Blue) - resulting in @zorroblue.</span></li>

                        <br>
                         This is pretty obvious. Being a Star Wars fan, Parth combined his first name with the last name of the most powerful Jedi that ever lived (Vader from Darth Vader) to end up with his username @Parth-Vader.</span></li>

After literally searching for 'Worst Cartoon Charecters', the then Google redirected him to <a href='http://monster10.com/The-10-Worst-Cartoon-Characters-Ever.htm' target='_blank'> this </a> page. Being the lazy guy he is, he chose the the cartoon character which was shown on the top of that page rather than scrolling down - Orko. This is how @OrkoHunter came into existence.</span></li>

                         Though Siddharth claims that he hadn't come across 'A Song of Ice and Fire' novel before fixing his username, the username 'icy' (Ice) + 'flame' (Fire) does perfectly blend in with this novel's name.</span></li>

                         Sameer was once interning in a company, when his boss asked him what he'd like to call himself on GitHub. For some 'unknown' reason, Sameer chose @v0dro as his handle, and started to like it ever since. It's also noteworthy to mention that he also went on to start the project <a href='https://github.com/SciRuby/daru' target='_blank'> 'Daru' </a> (Acronym of Data Analysis in RUby, and also coincidentally the Hindi word for Booze), which has been taken under the patronage of SciRuby organization.</span></li>

                <p> A huge token of thanks to everyone who shared the story behind their GitHub username! It was really an interesting experience for me to get to know about the various origin stories of usernames, and I hope it is equally interesting for the readers too. If possible, I'll try to come up with a part-2 of this post which may not be restricted to just GitHub usernames. If you'd like to get your story featured in that post, shoot me a mail at <a href='mailto:athityakumar@gmail.com' target='_blank'> athityakumar@gmail.com </a>. What do you think about this blog post?
