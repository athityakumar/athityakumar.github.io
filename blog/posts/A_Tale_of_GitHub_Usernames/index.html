              usernames / alter egos of people around you? Well, it is this eerie mystery 
              that this blog post aims to cover, around my circle of friends and mentors -
              at least, on the GitHub platform. Before starting with the actual blog post, 
              I&#39;d like to provide you with spoiler alert to some memes that have been 
              picked up from the scenes of TV series - &#39;The Flash&#39; and &#39;Breaking Bad&#39;.</p>
            <p><br>

            <p>Indeed. There are many users who prefer to have a mainstream username, which 
              directly exposes their name. The most common reason behind this is that, a 
              mainstream username looks more &#39;official&#39; at first sight. Need I give any 
              explanation for the below handles?</p>
            <h4> 
              <ul class='ui list'>
                <li><a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/kaustubhhiware">@kaustubhhiware</a> (Kaustubh Hiware) </li>

              </ul>
               </h4>
            <p>Infact, I myself belong to this category. My GitHub username is 
              <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/athityakumar">@athityakumar</a> - and I went for a 
              mainstream username because my name was already spelled weirdly 
              enough, that I didn&#39;t even have to think of a more weirder username.</p>

            <p>By a psuedo-mask, I mean that these usernames reveal the user&#39;s name - but 
              it&#39;s not just the name that is being revealed. </p>

            <p>These are the usernames from which the user&#39;s name can&#39;t be guessed

                      origins, and it means &#39;a small beast&#39; in Russian (зверёк). Seemingly, 
                      this username was selected randomly from the absurd play(s) that 
                      Victor had written with his friends of that time.</span></p>

                      Counter-Strike gaming within the Institute. But as this username was 
                      already taken on GitHub, Ayush added the James Bond number &#39;007&#39;, 
                      and made himself known as &#39;DefCon-007&#39; on GitHub.</span></p>

                      5th grade itself. During one of the Geography lectures, he came across 
                      the different Timezones, and was more attracted to the American Standard 
                      Time more than Indian Standard Time. Hence, he had decided that he&#39;d keep 
                      himself as @americanst in the digital world to not showcase any details 
                      about him. However, a typo while creating his first Yahoo account made 
                      sure that he&#39;d rather be called as @americast on all social media 
                      platforms. Although a typo, @americast does sound more cooler than 
                      @americanst - so, I guess it can be considered a &#39;Wonder Blunder&#39;.</span></p>

                      in writing. Hence, combining `ghost&#39; from linux username, &#39;writer&#39; from 
                      writing, &#39;n&#39; from Naresh and &#39;r&#39; from Ramesh, the username

                      ranks in the game, Dhruv got a good vibe from this nickname and went on 
                      to change his presence in all social media platforms to Ethan Hunt. 
                      Wanting to be unique, he chose the username &#39;the-ethan-hunt&#39;. </span></p>

                    <span style='font-weight:100;'> Being a hardcore fan of 
                      Beyblade&#39;s Kai and Zorro animated series, he wanted a username like Kai / 
                      Zorro. However, both Kai and Zorro usernames were already taken on 
                      GitHub. Hence, he combined Zorro, with his favourite color (Blue) - 
                      resulting in @zorroblue.</span></p>

                    <span style='font-weight:100;'> This is pretty obvious. Being 
                      a Star Wars fan, Parth combined his first name with the last name of the 
                      most powerful Jedi that ever lived (Vader from Darth Vader) to end up 
                      with his username @Parth-Vader.</span></p>

                      Impossible&#39; movies, Himanshu wanted a nickname that included Hunt / 
                      Hunter. However, as Hunter seemed like a surname, he began searching for 
                      a first name that he could use with Hunter. After literally searching for 
                      &#39;Worst Cartoon Charecters&#39;, the then Google redirected him to 
                      <a target='_blank' href="http://monster10.com/The-10-Worst-Cartoon-Characters-Ever.htm">this</a>
                      page. Being the lazy guy he is, he chose the the cartoon character 
                      which was shown on the top of that page rather than scrolling 
                      down - Orko. This is how @OrkoHunter came into existence.</span></p>

            <p>A huge token of thanks to everyone who shared the story behind their GitHub 
              username! It was really an interesting experience for me to get to know 
              about the various origin stories of usernames, and I hope it is equally 
              interesting for the readers too. If possible, I&#39;ll try to come up with a 
              part-2 of this post which may not be restricted to just GitHub usernames.
